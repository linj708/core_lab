			<h1>Design Principles</h1>
			<p>Each piece is part of a greater whole and should contribute positively to the system at scale. There should be no isolated features or outliers.<br>We're focused when it comes to both design and functionality. Our work should speak boldly and clearly to this focus.<br>Design should reinforce the meaning of content, not distract from it. We prioritize worthwhile communication over decoration. If an aspect of the design doesn't enhance the content, we should remove it.<br>Our use of motion breathes life into our products, and allows us to communicate with users in easily understood ways.<br>We create sites to welcome the widest possible audience, free of obstacles. Be mindful of the broad range of human abilities and disabilities, as well as the variety of devices, browsers, and networks people use to access our sites.</p>

			<p>"This is what body copy looks like. Strategic design means designing for a specific objective. More often than not, that objective is growing a business. But it's important to recognize that there's a difference between being strategic by being the conduit between the business and the user, and designing for the business alone."</p>
